## BTQ_MS High-Level Architecture Diagram

Both the Customer App (React Native and Web App) and the Management App (Next.js Frontend) communicate with a single Monolithic API, which is a Rails API serving both functionalities. The Monolithic API handles all requests from the client applications and contains all the business logic and functionalities. A shared database is still used for data storage, ensuring data consistency across the platform.

## Purpose and Challenges

In the traditional process, the person responsible for purchases encounters numerous challenges, including:

- **Supplier Knowledge and Price Estimation:** The individual must be familiar with different suppliers and have accurate price estimates for various products to determine the required budget.
  
- **Price Variation Management:** Fluctuating prices necessitate keeping track of price changes to ensure accurate cost estimations and updates at the store.
  
- **Inventory Updates and Shortages:** Awareness of product shortages and anticipated restock dates is essential for managing inventory effectively.
  
- **Human Error and Inconsistencies:** The paper-based system is prone to errors, leading to inconsistent purchasing decisions and inaccuracies.
  
- **Dependency on a Single Individual:** In case of absence of the person in charge, continuity of the process becomes challenging, as someone else must take over without sufficient knowledge.
